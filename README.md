# cms
New OpenS3 Content Management System. Written in Kotlin. 

Intended for a few projects. Eliminated the need for tons of JS on the front end.

## Building
Run 
> ./gradlew clean build

## Running
Run
> java -jar build/libs/kettlebell-competition-server-0.0.1-all.jar

## Recommendations
I would recommend putting this server behind NGINX if exposing it to the internet.
